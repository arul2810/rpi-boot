This Repository contains all Raspberry Pi Boot configurations

Instead of the BIOS found on a conventional PC, Raspberry Pi devices use a configuration file called config.txt. The GPU reads config.txt before the Arm CPU and Linux initialise. Raspberry Pi OS looks for this file in the boot partition, located at /boot/firmware/.
